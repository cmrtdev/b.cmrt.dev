I've been telling myself (and I've been told repeatedly) that writing a blog so I can remember:

1. how I fixed whatever I broke, and
2. what steps I had to go through to make computer do computer things

would be a good idea.

Well, I don't have anything to write about today, but - unless something drastically changes in the near future - I probably will have something soon, so...

_Let's do this. :)_
